# Project-Chess
This is a project from The Odin Project

This command-line game is a two-player game without AI. (You are welcome to add in the AI feature.)
The game only allows the players to play on the same computer on the same terminal. There is no networking feature integrated in the game such that players can play on 
remote computers. (Ofcourse, you're welcome to add in the feature)
The Rspec tests are not yet written. You may write tests for any of the three classes if you wish to. The rspec files are located in chess/spec directory.

Unsolved bug:
1. After saving game, the game cannot be loaded properly after that. The unicode characters are messed up. The characters appearing on the
   "chess board" are no longer chess pieces.
